## How to Install an Ethereum node (with Parity)

To setup an Ethereum node on Ubuntu 18.04 follow these steps:
- Copy repository to server (i.e. SFTP via Filezilla)
- Run the below commands

```
chmod +x ./setup.sh && ./setup.sh
```

While the setup script is running, it will attempt to install Rust and that will prompt user input. 
Enter "1" to Proceed with installation (default) - unless you have a specific need.
